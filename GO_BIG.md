# GO BIG

I decided to make a bigger version of the Snow Globe based on the following hardware:
- Qualia ESP32-S3 RBG-666 40p TFT - https://www.adafruit.com/product/5800
- 2.1 Inch 480x480 Cap Display (round) - https://www.adafruit.com/product/5792
- Clear Fillable Ornaments Balls 80mm/3.15" -https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF2GXVSN

I had done some experiments with the electronics combination here and had no memory problems doing succesive images.
