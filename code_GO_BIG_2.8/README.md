# Code
The code for the 2.1 inch or 2.8 inch round TFT display is only different by one line, so there is one "README" type file that contains the description for both displays.

To see information about the hardware and the code used in the SnowGlobe ornament with Qualia ESP32-S3 and either a 2.1 inch or 2.8 inch round TFT display, look here:
